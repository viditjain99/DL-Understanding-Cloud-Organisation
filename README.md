# Understanding-Cloud-Organisation
Climate change is one of the greatest threat that the hu- manity is dealing with today. It has put a question mark on our future survival and we have proceeded in a direc- tion to be extinct. It has been found that climate change can be determined by shallow clouds. And to understand the clouds we need to understand their organisation, the dif- ferent organisations they form in the sky. There are three different shapes the clouds form, Flower, Gravel, Sugar and Fish. There is a human annotated data available by Max Planck Institute about the clouds and their organi- sations. The boundary between different organisations is murky, so we are aiming to use deep learning models to get the boundaries between these shapes and correctly identify which cloud organisation shapes are present in an image. Through this project, we are automating the pattern detec- tion of clouds to learn global climatologies for these four patterns. We have used two state of the art image segmen- tation models for this task. U-net and Res-net. This under- standing of cloud structure might help researchers to under- stand the climate change better, which further with political involvement can be resulted in policy implementations to help save the climate.
